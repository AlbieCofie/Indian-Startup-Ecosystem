## Title: 

Develop a Machine Learning API (Application Programming Interface) using FastAPI

# Introduction

India has one of the world's fastest expanding economies. We have witnessed a huge number of unicorn startups emerge in the Indian startup ecosystem over the last decade, with a global influence. Startups may be small businesses, but they can have a huge impact on economic growth. They generate more jobs, which leads to increased employment, and increased employment leads to a healthier economy. Not only that, but startups can also contribute to economic vitality by encouraging innovation and injecting competition.


## Description

## Importance of Project Â 

The objective of this project is to give insights to key stakeholders interested in venturing into the Indian startup ecosystem. To achieve this, we will be analyzing key metrics in funding received by startups in India from 2018 to 2021. These insights will be used by Management to make informed business decisions.

# Dataset Description -

The data for this project is in a csv format. The following describes the columns present in the data.

| Column Name | Description                                                                    |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Company/Brand          | Name of the Company/Startup
                                        |

## Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...` follow the steps below:

- Windows:

```python
python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

- Linux & MacOs:

```python
python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt
```

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol `;` but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.
